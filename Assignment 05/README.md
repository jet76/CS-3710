# Assignment 5
- Use assignment 2's JSON API to create a Single Page Application
- Display everything your app did via HTML in your display
- Make sure to make all requests via Ajax so that the URL does not change even though the information displayed does
- You are not required to upload information, only display it; C/U/D operations via Ajax are extra credit

- Recommended to put .html file in public directory of your application so you don't run into any CORS issues
- Remember to bring up your browser's web console to help you debug your SPA. you can also use the console.log method to print values to the web console
